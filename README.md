# Introduction:
Welcome to my GitHub!  
I am a current 3rd year student studying at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, with majors in biomedical engineering 
and computer science. My past experience has largely been in the computational biology field, working with genomic data
and finding trends and indicators for cancer as well as cardiovascular disease. I hope to gain even more experience 
in the future with courses like machine learning and natural language processing to develop applications.This space will serve
mostly as my workspace for informal/independent projects that have no conflict with my university allowing me to share
source code.

A few projects not listed on this page include a rudimentary photoshop tool written in ANSI C and a chess simulator written in C++, both of which were made without the use of APIs or such. The functionality of the photoshop tool allowed for grayscale, cropping, saturation, and channel swapping of the input photo. The C++ chess game simulated a full game of chess until either a stalemate or checkmate was reached. Additionally, the chess game allowed the saving of a current game and the loading of previous matches. The code for this projects is not allowed to be publicly available as they were crucial projects in the EN.601.220 course within the CS department at JHU, but can be shared upon request through reaching me at my email: ngarza@jhu.edu
