# For Your Information:
Welcome to my GitHub!  
I am a current 3rd year student studying at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, with majors in biomedical engineering 
and computer science. My past experience has largely been in the computational biology field, working with genomic data
and finding trends and indicators for cancer as well as cardiovascular disease. I hope to gain even more experience 
in the future with courses like machine learning and natural language processing to develop applications.This space will serve
mostly as my workspace for informal/independent projects that have no conflict with my university allowing me to share
source code.
